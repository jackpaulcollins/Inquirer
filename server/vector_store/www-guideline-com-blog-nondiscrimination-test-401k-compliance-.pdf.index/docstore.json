That’s what the two major\n401(k) nondiscrimination tests try to assess each year.\nWhat do you need to do to pass the tests? Well, our friends at the IRS have made\nthat piece of the equation a little more complex, so let’s take a closer look at what\neach nondiscrimination test measures, how to apply them, and what it means if\nyour plan fails. As you read this, also keep in mind that it’s possible to set up a Safe\nHarbor 401(k) plan, that's exempt from most nondiscrimination testing.¹\n\nWhat are the nondiscrimination tests?","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":19}}}}],["1",{"pageContent":"What are the nondiscrimination tests?\n\nTo give everyone an opportunity to save for the future, a 401(k) plan can’t favor\nhighly compensated employees (HCEs) or key employees (such as owners).\nNondiscrimination tests help make sure everything is fair by looking at how much\nof their income diﬀerent employees defer, how much the company contributes to\nemployee accounts, and what percentage of assets in the plan belong to the HCEs\nand key employees. According to the IRS 401(k) Plan Overview: “[These tests]\n\fverify that deferred wages and employer matching contributions do not\ndiscriminate in favor of highly compensated employees.”\n\nThere are two annual nondiscrimination tests a 401(k) sponsor must pass:\n\n  The Actual Deferral Percentage (ADP) test\n  The Actual Contribution Percentage (ACP) test\n\nGenerally, plans must also pass a third compliance test, the Top-Heavy test, each\nyear, or else they are subject to additional employer contributions to keep the plan\nin qualiﬁed status.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":19,"to":37}}}}],["2",{"pageContent":"Generally, plans must also pass a third compliance test, the Top-Heavy test, each\nyear, or else they are subject to additional employer contributions to keep the plan\nin qualiﬁed status.\n\nUltimately, whether a plan passes discrimination testing is a function of which\nemployees participate by deferring income to their 401(k) accounts, how much\nthey defer, and how much a company contributes.\n\nEmployee participation","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":37,"to":45}}}}],["3",{"pageContent":"Employee participation\n\nParticipation in a 401(k) plan is optional. Research found that in 2020, plans with\nautomatic enrollment had a 92% participation rate, compared with a participation\nrate of 62% for plans with voluntary enrollment. If employees don’t have the extra\nmoney to set aside, don’t see the value in saving for their future, or don’t know\nabout their plan, then they may not choose to participate. This lack of\nparticipation, coupled with high participation among HCEs and key employees\nmay make the plan more likely to fail a nondiscrimination test. It’s up to the plan\nsponsor to make sure there’s broad participation.\n\nEmployer contributions\n\nHow a company contributes to its employees’ 401(k) savings can also have a big\nimpact on whether it will pass nondiscrimination testing. We’ll get into it below, but\nhere are two types of contributions:\n\fhere are two types of contributions:","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":45,"to":61}}}}],["4",{"pageContent":"Matching contributions, which are company contributions that are made based\n  on how much employees choose to defer.\n  Nonelective contributions, which are made whether or not an employee defers\n  income to his or her 401(k).\n\nSometimes employer contributions are also subject to a vesting period, which\nmeans they are forfeited if an employee leaves the company before a speciﬁc\ndate.\n\nWhile employees appreciate matching contributions because it means they’ll get\nadditional money in their nest egg, these contributions beneﬁt employers, too:\nNice perks keep employees happier, contributions qualify as tax-deductible\nbusiness expenses, and they tend to help 401(k) plans avoid discrimination issues\nwhen structured correctly.\n\nWho exactly are “Highly Compensated\nEmployees”?","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":63,"to":79}}}}],["5",{"pageContent":"Who exactly are “Highly Compensated\nEmployees”?\n\nThe ADP and ACP tests look for discrimination by comparing the average deferrals\nand contributions of your “highly compensated employees” (HCEs) with the\naverages of non-highly compensated employees (NHCEs).

The IRS deﬁnes an HCE as an individual who:\n\n  Owned more than 5% of the interest in the business at any time during the\n  testing year or the preceding year (including certain family members via\n  attribution rules), regardless of how much compensation that person earned or\n  received, OR\n  Received compensation from the business of more than $130,000, during the\n  preceding year ($135,000 for 2022) AND was in the top 20% of employees when\n  ranked by compensation.\n\f  ranked by compensation.\nIf someone doesn’t meet either of those conditions, they are an NHCE.\n\nThe nondiscrimination tests in action","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":79,"to":97}}}}],["6",{"pageContent":"The nondiscrimination tests in action\n\nThis is all a little complex, so let’s look at an example to keep this from turning into\nan acronym salad.

We ﬁnd their\nlanguage pretty hard to understand, so we reworked it to make it clearer. You can\nsee their original testing formula in the IRS 401(k) Plan Fix-It Guide.\n\nBoth the ADP and the ACP tests only look at the most recent full plan year.

To\napply these tests to the employees of Winterfell Consulting, let’s review the\nWinterfell NHCE’s ADP and ACP test results:\n\nThe ADP Test: The NHCEs had an average ADP of 3%. That means the ADP of\nHCEs can’t be more than 5% (the 3% NHCEs deferred, plus 2%). Winterfell’s HCE\ndefers 10%, so this plan fails the ADP test.\n\nThe ACP Test: The Winterfell NHCEs received an average contribution that was\n1.5% of their W-2 income. To pass the test, HCEs can’t receive more than double\nthe NHCE average — a maximum of 3% in this case. It turns out that the HCE\nreceives 3%, so this plan passes the ACP test by the narrowest of margins.\n\fTop-Heavy Test\n\nThe third compliance test a plan must pass, the top-heavy test, is a little diﬀerent\nfrom ACP and ADP because it focuses on “key employees” within an organization,\nrather than HCEs.\n\nKey employees are deﬁned by the IRS as:","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":161,"to":179}}}}],["11",{"pageContent":"Key employees are deﬁned by the IRS as:\n\n  An oﬃcer making over $200,000 in the plan year for 2022, OR\n  Anyone who owns more than 5% of the business (including certain family\n  members via attribution rules), OR\n  An employee owning more than 1% of the business (including certain family\n  members via attribution rules) and making over $150,000 for the plan year.\n\nThe top-heavy test is also diﬀerent because it tests the plan’s balance as of\nDecember 31st of the previous year (or current year, if it is the plan’s ﬁrst year). A\nplan fails the top-heavy test when the value of the assets in key employees’\naccounts is more than 60% of all assets held in an employer’s 401(k) plan.","metadata":{"loc":{"lines":{"from":179,"to":190}}}}],["12",{"pageContent":"Returning to our example, let’s assume this is the ﬁrst year of Winterfell\nConsulting’s plan and that the assets in the plan appreciate at 10% over the course\nof the year.
